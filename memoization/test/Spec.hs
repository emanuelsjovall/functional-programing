-- TESTING FIBONACCI

-- This is a function to generate
-- Integers between 1 and 20
-- (We'll use that to test our fibonacci functions)
smallInteger :: Gen Int
smallInteger = elements [1..20]

-- First tests,
-- Fibo 0 should always be 1
-- Fibo 1 should always be 1
-- (===) will print the values if left and right aren't equal
fibo0, fibo1 :: Property
fibo0 = fibo 0 === 0
fibo1 = fibo 1 === 1

-- Second test,
-- For any n above 2, fibo n == fibo (n-1) + fibo (n-2)
fiboDef :: Int -> Property
-- (==>) will only check the property if (n > 2) (otherwise, discard)
fiboDef n = n > 2 ==> fibo n === fibo (n-1) + fibo (n-2) -- Very costly, runs fibo three times

-- We will only test our property with tiny values of n
-- (Otherwise the tests take too long)
-- We use smallInteger to generate small random n's to try
-- "forAllShrink" is a function which checks the property with the provided generator
-- (here, 'smallInteger')
-- "shrink" is a function which will try to find small counter-examples.
quickFiboDef :: Property

-- Quickcheck is great for checking optimizations
-- We throw random data to the two functions and check they return the same results!
-- (Note we have to use tiny numbers, because "fibo" can take a long time)...

  -- Our test is that both functions return the same result
  -- If there's a conter-example, we'll print the results of the two functions
  fibo n === fastFibo n

-- The function above would be slow if we generated
-- numbers that are too big, so we make a variant
-- Which will use a generator for small integers
-- to generate a small integer, and test with fiboEquivalence

-- TESTING LONGEST PALYNDROMIC SEQUENCE

-- Third test: If we give the function a palindrome
-- It returns the full string

-- We check that the slow function returns the same results

-- *** Failed! Falsified (after 1 test and 5 shrinks):
-- 1 <- Inputs for which the property failed

-- Testing LPS...
-- +++ OK, passed 100 tests.
