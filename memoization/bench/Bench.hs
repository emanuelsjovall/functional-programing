-- The defaultMain is provided by criterion
-- We make benchmark groups
-- 'bench' creates a benchmark, with a label,
-- and 'whnf' will evaluate the expression it's provided, measuring how long it takes.

-- When we measure something, we don't run it once and measure the time,
-- We run it as many times as possible for a fixed time, count the iterations,
-- and give the mean / stddev.
